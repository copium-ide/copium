# copium
c++ rewrite of the d one

uses sdl3 and diligent rendering

Reasons:
i didnt wanna deal with oudated bindings
i dont wanna write bindings
all my libraries i use are native to c++
garbage collector was obtrusive


# How to build
cd to setup/
run `linux.sh` or `windows.bat` depending on your system
build with whatever it spits out (in my case, i use `make` to build)
