# copium
c++ rewrite of the d one<br>

uses sdl3 and diligent rendering<br>

Reasons:<br>
i didnt wanna deal with oudated bindings<br>
i dont wanna write bindings<br>
all my libraries i use are native to c++<br>
garbage collector was obtrusive<br>


# How to build
cd to setup/<br>
run `linux.sh` or `windows.bat` depending on your system<br>
build with whatever it spits out (in my case, i use `make` to build)<br>
